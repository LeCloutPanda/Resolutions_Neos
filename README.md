[NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos](https://neos.com/) that lets you control what resolution Finger Photos are taken at.
 
# Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [Resolutions.dll](https://github.com/LeCloutPanda/Resolutions/releases/download/v1.0.2/Resolutions.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install.
